# Woodle
As would be obvious from the name, the game is inspired from the famous game Wordle The difference between the two is that unlike wordle, the game allows you to try more than once over the course of the day. The user presses shift key instead of enter after every try. The inpsiration for this came from a random conversation I had with my own friend, who mentioned he could solve wordle really fast but after using a good number of tries. This game tries to address this by scoring the user on both the number of attempts as well as the time taken. In simple terms, someone who guesses the word within 1-2 tries, but takes lesser time could get a higher score than someone who guesses it right on the first attempt, but takes a significant amount of time.

I would be adding database support soon, to incorporate leaderboards.
